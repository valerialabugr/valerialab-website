The EUROfusion programme is based on the Roadmap to the Realisation of Fusion Energy. The programme has two aims:
* Preparing for ITER experiments.
* Developing concepts for the future demonstration fusion power plant DEMO.

The University of Granada (and particularly the VALERIA lab) participates in EUROfusion associated to the National Center for Research on Energy, Environment and Technology ([CIEMAT](https://www.ciemat.es/)). Our group develops virtual reality simulations of the maintenance tasks to be performed for the Test Cell and Accelerator System in IFMIF-DONES.

The 30 European consortium members, receive funding for fusion projects in accordance with their participation in the missions and experiments outlined in the Roadmap. Moreover, the EUROfusion programme supports fusion education and training through the EUROfusion Researcher Grant and EUROfusion Engineering Grant schemes. EUROfusion also supports diverse research projects in the participating laboratories through the Enabling Research scheme.
