![Álvaro González](/img/agonzalez.jpg)

I am a PhD student at the Computational Neuroscience and Neurorobotics Lab of the University of Granada. I hold a degree in Psychology and a second degree in Computer Science. I am MSc in Neuroscience at the University of Granada. 

I am interested in motor control and learning for robotics. Specifically I am studying the basal ganglia, a brain region involved in reward evaluation and action selection. With precise models of basal ganglia it will be possible to create better motor controllers for robots, and to obtain better understanding of some brain diseases (like Parkinson's or Huntington's disease).
