## Short bio

I got a degree in Computer Engineering in 2020 at Universidad de Granada and I did the Erasmus program at Università degli Studi di Salerno, Italy. I also got a Master in Videogame Development in 2021 at Universidad de Málaga. I joined the VALERIA lab in 2022. In VALERIA Lab I work in the development of multi-user systems and virtual reality to the project IFMIF-DONES.

## Research interests

My interests are development of multi-user systems and artificial intelligence to videogames. I am able to adapt to different environments and work teams. My programming codes are clean, accessible and scalable.
