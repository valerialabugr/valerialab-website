## Short bio

I got a degree in Design and Development of Video Games in 2019 at Jaume I University and I did the Game Lab program at Hanzehogeschool University of Applied Science in Groningen, Netherlands. Since then, I were working as a programmer in different jobs until I joined the VALERIA lab in 2020. I also got an MSc in Software Development in 2021 at Universidad de Granada. In VALERIA Lab I work in the development of an interactive virtual simulation of the project IFMIF-DONES where the users can move the different parts of the facility in order to perform the required task such as moving cranes, replacement of equipment and inspection of tools.

## Research interests

My interestes are development of interactive simulations and development of video games. Due to my background I am able to adapt into different work environments and teams.
I like to learn about different technologies such as HMD displays, game engines, haptic devices and so on.
