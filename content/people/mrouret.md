## Short bio

I got a degree and MSc in Electronics engineering in 2017 at Universidad Nacional del Comahue, in 2020 I got an MSc in Physics at Universidad de Granada and in 2021 an MSc in Videogame development at the Tokio School Academy.
Currently I am working for the VALERIA lab under the project IFMIF-DONES. We are developing virtual reality simulations that allow users to have a better grasp of how the facilities will look like and whether the different maintenance tasks can be achieved efficiently. These simulations will also take part in training operaries to perform the required tasks, moving cranes, robotic arms and other equipment in the rooms.

## Research interests

My interdisciplinary value is located between Electronics and Video Game development. Having worked with different pieces of hardware in the past allows me to have a quick understanding of its capabilities and adapt to different scenarios, like connecting real life robots to game engines softwares. My research interest deals with achieving a high immersive system for the users, that allows them to fully understand and manipulate the simulations taking place.
In order to achieve so multiple pieces of hardware have to be tested and integrated with the game engine used to develop the simulation, such as AR glasses, VR glasses, haptic devices and so on.
